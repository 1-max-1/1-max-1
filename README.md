## Welcome 👋

🤖 I'm Max and I am currently pursuing a Mechatronics Engineering degree at the University of Canterbury. I love to learn and I'm passionate about all aspects of STEM.

🏂 When I'm not working on projects, you can find me rock climbing, mountain biking or snowboarding.

👨‍💻 My biggest current tech-related interest is electronics and software for microcontrollers and other embedded systems.

⚡ Some interesting (maybe) things that I've worked on recently:
- 🚥 [rgb-matrix](https://github.com/1-max-1/rgb-matrix) - this is a PCB that drives a 8x8 matrix of RGB LED's. The repository also contains code for communicating with and controlling the outputs on the PCB.
- ℹ [WASMSerialTerminal](https://github.com/1-max-1/WASMSerialTerminal) - every once in a while I need to communicate with devices that talk through the old serial ports. I made this webapp to achive this, so I can just boot up a browser instead of needing to download some desktop app every time.
- 🔒 [Door lock](https://github.com/1-max-1/arcady-door-lock/blob/main/README.md) - this is an electromechanical door lock powered by an esp32 and a couple of servos. A touchscreen on the front of the door allows users to input a password before the door unlocks. It employs gears ad a creative mechanism to prevent the lock from getting jammed.
- 🧗‍♂️ [Fake kilter board](https://github.com/1-max-1/fake_kilter_board) - a Kilter board is a climbing wall with light up holds. It communicates with the official mobile app through bluetooth (specifically BLE). I wanted to figure out how it works so I could send my own commands to it with my own software. After alot of reverse engineering, I uncovered enough details that I was able to make my own fake climbing wall using a microcontroller with built in bluetooth capabilities. I could then use this fake wall to test other software intended for controlling a real one.
